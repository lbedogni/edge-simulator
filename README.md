# edge-simulator

Novel edge simulator/emulator for IoT nodes. Still work in progress.

The goals of the project are:
* To provide an easy to use platform to run simulation/emulation of Edge nodes
* To provide a series of nodes which can be simulated, together with a validation of the model
* To make it possible to use the code of the nodes in the simulated platform, so that no code-duplication is necessary
